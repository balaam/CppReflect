# Explore

Explore is a collection of small programs. Exploring one aspect of building a reflection system in C++. I find it easier to build from small clear examples into something bigger.

## Member Pointer

Demonstates the syntax to get pointers to a struct's fields. (This would also work for class)

## Member Pointer Template

Building on the previous example tests whether a structure be created with an array of all the fields of a class.
